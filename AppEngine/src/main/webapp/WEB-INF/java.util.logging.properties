# Route JDK JUL logging through SLF4J to Log4J
# JUL config enables full logging and sets up a bridge that handles JUL -> SLF4J routing
# LogJ4 config receives all logs and filters them according to the configuration
# App uses SLF4J so that just directly routes to Log4J in DEV and JUL in PROD
# PROD routes app's SLF4J to JUL through Gradle compile dependency which is ignored in DEV.
# For this to work the following jars must be on the bootstrap classpath in DEV
# (edit launch configuration classpath):
#     * jul-to-slf4j
#     * slf4j-api
#     * slf4j-log4j12
#     * log4j
# See log4j2.xml for more info on DEV setup.

# otherwise you'll get the following error:
# Can't load log handler "org.slf4j.bridge.SLF4JBridgeHandler"
# java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.slf4j.bridge.SLF4JBridgeHandler
handlers=org.slf4j.bridge.SLF4JBridgeHandler
