	Where there may be no nearby line interchanges possible, leaving the station may benefit your overall journey time.
	This means you can get farther in the same amount of time.

	<ul>
		<li>

		TfL will likely count these as fully leaving/entering the system</a>.
	\nThere are some stations where you can make an interchange and TfL may count it as an intra-station interchange;
	examples of this:
	<ul>
		<li>Hammersmith (
			<station line="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</station>
		    ⇌
			<station line="Circle">Circle</station>
		    )
		</li>
		<li>Shadwell (
			<station line="DLR">DLR</station>
		    ⇌
			<station line="Overground">Overground</station>
		    )
		</li>
		<li>Canary Wharf (
			<station line="Jubilee">Jubilee</station>
		    ⇌
			<station line="DLR">DLR</station>
		    )
		</li>
	</ul>
	However, to simplify these exceptions these are treated as inter-station interchanges by the algorithm.
